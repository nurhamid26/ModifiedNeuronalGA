# Dynamic Path Planning for USV with Modified Neuronal Genetic Algorithm 

This project aims to solve USV dynamic environmental challenges and convergence problems in evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithm). We propose a neuronal genetic algorithm that utilizes neural network input for processing with a genetic operator. The modifications were implemented by incorporating a partially exponential-based fitness function into the neuronal genetic algorithm. We also implemented an inverse time variable to the fitness function.
